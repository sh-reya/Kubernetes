# Kubernetes

# What is kubernetes and how is it important for us?

  For eg. we launch a number of containers and if any one of them crashes, the monitoring team will have a touch time running another container. Such kind of delay is inevitable for humans. 
   Also, it might lead to loss of information and bad user experience.
   
  ### Kubernetes or K8s comes to recue
   We launch anew program whose role is to monitor the containers. If any of them go down, k8s restarts or launches another one as per requirement.
     This process is known as "Management of container".
     K8s is a program/software that is used to manage the container.
     
   This is one of the many use of Kubernetes.
